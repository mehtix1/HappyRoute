## Overview  
**HappyRoute** is a system for vehicular ad hoc networks (**VANETs**) which uses blockchain-based incentives to encourage cooperative routing. The idea is to integrate routing protocols (e.g. AODV, OLSR, SMART) with a token-based reward mechanism so that nodes are motivated to honestly forward packets, thereby improving performance and trust in the network.

This repository holds simulation scripts, routing protocol implementations, and incentive integration logic.

## Features  
- Integration of classical VANET routing protocols (AODV, OLSR, SMART)  
- Incentive mechanism using blockchain / tokens to reward forwarding  
- Comparative simulation framework to measure performance under incentive vs no incentive  
- Mobility trace / scenario scripts for testing different traffic conditions
